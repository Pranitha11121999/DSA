Problem Description:

Given a binary search tree A, where each node contains a positive integer, and an integer B, you have to find whether or not there exist two different nodes X and Y such that X.value + Y.value = B. Return 1 to denote that two such nodes exist. Return 0, otherwise.

Problem Constraints:

1 <= size of tree <= 100000
1 <= B <= 109



Input Format:

First argument is the head of the tree A.
Second argument is the integer B.



Output Format:

Return 1 if such a pair can be found, 0 otherwise.
